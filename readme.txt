Color Pop is a game based off of the Facebook Messenger game Brick Pop, in which the player “pops” bricks of the same color by section, and attempts to get rid of all the bricks on the board. The game ends when there are blocks left on the board that cannot be popped, or are in sections of less than two of the same color.

In Color Pop, I added different levels of difficulty based on number of colors of blocks in the board, and the biggest section size allowed when creating the board. In addition, I added another mode, “Timed Mode,” in which the player attempts to finish as many boards as possible in five minutes. I also included a tutorial for the game.

To run Color Pop, just run the file colorPop.py, which has imported all the other files into it.
